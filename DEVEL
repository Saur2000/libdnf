options / repo options:
enable_filelists (lazy file lists?)
repo content type = mixed, binary, source, devel, debug; auto-detection from repoid instead?

keyring
 - global, per-repo
 - ability to manage trusted keys by admin (regular user cannot manage the keys)


RepoDict -> Repos/RepoContainer?
@System & @Commandline repos part of it


versionlock - from python plugin to libdnf core?


introduce libdnf.arch
- arm - let Peter Robinson to review the arch list

logging
- drop, use journald?


deb and rpm in parallel
multisemantics mode?
it's turned on in Fedora
for queries, etc.
deb2solv etc.
debconf - callback system; dpkg pauses in interactive mode
depkg devert? - no alternative in rpm (possibly similar to relocations but smarter)


perms:
root_user -> privileged_user
or fine-grained perms for individual actions
